   color picker canvas to provide users with a pre-defined
   selection of colors to choose from

All JavaScript functions used in the plugin code as well as
all CSS rules use the prefix jrp_ with a view to creating 
a unique namespace.

To provide a bigger palette of pre-defined colors for your
users to choose just replace rainbow.png with a suitable
image 470 pixels wide and 328 pixels high.

There can be  little reason to replace the chequered 
background image.  Should you wish to do so simply replace
the contents of checks.png.

The minified versions of the .js and .css files were created
using the excellent online tools provided Esben Sundgaard at
